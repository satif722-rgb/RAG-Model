    "text": " intro Hi everyone, I am your Shraddha Didi and today we have brought a brand new Python course for you after doing this course you will be learning about the most important programming concepts of Python from basic installation now if you are a student who has studied something like C++, Java, JavaScript and now you want to learn Python or if you are a student who is going to do programming from the beginning then this video is made for you after watching this video if you want you can prepare for college placements, do competitive coding, learn about frameworks like Django in web development or learn things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science to do this video we will need only two things, first is a laptop and second is a lot of excitement so let's start our brand new Python course Python is a very beautiful language which is used in a lot of big companies big companies like Google, YouTube, Instagram, Netflix, Uber use Python to make their software now we will learn about installation, how to install Python in your laptop, in your machine and how to install the code which we are doing on the software so here we have made the installation process for Windows users and Mac users so you can go to the time stamp given below and see which installation you need to do first of all let's start our Windows installation so to install Python in Windows first of all we have to go to a website named python.org we have given the link of the website in the notes below and you can see it on the screen so by going to downloads we will download Python 3.1 0.0 after downloading we will open this file in our folder then we have to click on the exe file and install it now the software we will use to write Python in Windows is called PyScripter PyScripter is an open source free software which we can go to the site after going to the website we have downloaded it once after that we will have a window of different options so inside the window we have to click on next next now after installing we have to click on execute and after that our installation will be complete we will get options like what language we want to select which folder we want to make default where our Python file will be saved we will click on next next and finally we will install now inside the setup window we will click on next and for us the window of our PyScripter will open now we will clear this module and now we will start writing our entire code from the beginning to output anything in Python we have to write print and after that we write the entire statement now the lines highlighted above are comments which are not part of the code and below the print we have written is a function function code is that part which gives us an operation or a task then we have used parenthesis functions are always written with parenthesis in Python and inside that we have written what we have to print so we have written hello world now we have written hello world with double quotes so whatever text is there in Python we write it in quotes we could have written hello world in single quotes but since I am from Java C++ background so my habit is that I write strings in double quotes and characters like a,b,c,d I write them in single quotes that's why I prefer to write strings in double quotes now after clicking the green run button we will run our code and below we have output hello world and above we can see our Python version which is 3.10.0 now instead of hello world if we want to print hello coders then we can do that too we just have to write print hello coders we can run this too and if we want to print something else then we can print a whole sentence that I know how to count in which we can print 1,2,3,4,5,6 numbers and that will come on our output screen now if we want we can save this whole Python code in a file so to save it in a file we will go to file and click save as and then we will give any name of our choice now by default we have to save Python files code with .py that's why we will name our file as firstprogram.py and we have saved it and we can see this new name in our IDE now in the next tutorial I have used Pycharm because in my system virtual machine windows can't run for a long time that's why in the next course whatever code we have written we have to write all those codes in the same way in PyScripter and just click on the run button and we have to wait for a while there will be no error or any problem for us the editor we are using in macOS is named Pycharm to install Pycharm we have to go to JetBrains site and install Pycharm there now after installing when we will open it we have to drag it directly and put it in our applications folder and while opening we have to keep the settings in default that's why we will keep on oking all the things and finally Pycharm will open for us so we have installed Pycharm now we will start by opening our software so here we will see a window now we can create different projects in this these are the projects in which we can put many python files so first of all we will make a new project for ourselves here we will write the name of the project so we will give the name of the project Apna College and this is the path before the name of the project this is the path where all the files of our project will be saved in our computer so all the python files we will write in our project will be saved here in this location after that we can choose our environment from here environment is a little advanced topic so if we are starting a new coding journey so for now we will ignore this here we have taken our base interpreter as python now already in the computer there were other versions of python but we have chosen the latest version it is possible that when you open your Pycharm so all these options are not coming in it you are able to create a new project directly in it you don't have to make changes in the settings so there is nothing to worry about here we will create if we already want a python file which is a sample file then we can tick this option but we will make our file by ourselves so let's start by un-ticking it and here our Pycharm is open so here our python files where will they be stored? they will be stored in this folder this Apna College, whatever name we gave to the project a folder has been created in our location and in this folder we can see different files now in this folder we have to create a python file so what we will do is right click go to new and go to python file we can name this python file anything suppose we want to name it first program so after naming it first program here a python file has been created and here this file has been opened so here we can write our code now you will know that the name of the file is firstprogram.py so all the python files their extension is .py like if we have used Microsoft word then in that or in notepad or in windows we can save the file with .txt that it is a text file that's why here python is saved with .py like c++ file is saved with .cpp or java with .java so there is some extension of that here we have some files of our virtual environment so from here we can see that if we have a lot of python files then which file we have to go in and which file we don't have to go in but we are working on the same file so here we will click on this minus button and hide it so now we will focus on our python file all our python programs we will be writing here we will make it little big text wise now we will be writing our first python program now this is the program which is written in other languages which is written in other languages which is called hello world so usually when you learn a new language you print hello world and learn on a new screen now if you are coding in python then you are doing something in the program but the output of that program how will we see that we will learn that now for output we have to write print after print we will put parenthesis so we call these brackets as parenthesis inside these we can print anything whatever we have to print from the program now here we are going to print hello world and here the double quotes which we have put they represent the string what is string? whenever any text, character like abcd, afgh, at the rate, hash 1,2,3,4 we write these in double quotes so it becomes text text means which we can't change it will be same now if we have to print string then this statement is enough a small key point java is a case sensitive language means you can't make this small p big p otherwise a red line will come and then error will come because big p doesn't exist so you can print things now the parenthesis we have used shows what is print? it is a function in python now what are functions? how we can make them? we will learn that later for now let's learn that print is a function in java, whatever we have to print on screen we can write it inside and now we will run this code to run there is a run option inside run you go and click run on first program and here in output screen we have print hello world now there are many keyboard shortcuts like when you go to run so here this ctrl shift r is the keyboard shortcut so those who are using mac can use this for windows there will be a different shortcut so you can use it accordingly so like this you will remember shortcuts so your code will be completed faster now we will learn about variables in python now if we have to store any data inside python so how we will store it? we know that if there is any data inside python so it will eventually go to computer's memory and store so the computer's memory where data is stored we will give it a name so next time we will know where data was stored what is its name so we call this name variable in python variables define memory's location where data is stored so like suppose we have to store a name so for name we have written variable we can give name of variable name of variable is name and we want to store a string inside variable so we will store name with this suppose you want to make another variable you have made variable age you don't want to store string inside age you want to store number so here we have stored number now what we can do we can print this name now to print if we write like this so what will be printed for us let's see if we print name directly inside codes so for us name will be printed directly that name will not be variable whatever goes inside strings it doesn't take its value it prints it as it is so here we will be writing name and if we run it now what is printed we have stored value inside name in the same way we can print age with name and here age will be printed now these variables we have made if we give value inside it then we can change that value means by changing name if we want to do something else by changing age then those values will change and now the name and age will be different so according to this if we made variable then values inside it can change now we will be talking about 4 major types of variables in python first we have learned that string is there one we have learned that number is there now this number we have seen here is an integer number suppose if we 24 we have to make 24.0 so this type of number we call floating number in python and this was our integer now there are 4th type of variables in python we call them boolean boolean defines if something is true or false so in boolean two type of values can be stored either it can be true or false so here according to our age suppose we have written adult so in this adult we can write true now this red line came because java is case sensitive and in true actually T is capital so if we don't take care of case if we keep capital of things we will make them small or small one will be capital then error can come here we can write false also if our age was less than 18 similarly we can define boolean variables in python special thing of python is you don't have to tell before defining variables that which type this variable is going to be you can store any value in any variable without defining any type now to define variable you can use 2-3 strings in between you can use underscore so like this there are many names to define variables what are the rules you can get in notes now before moving ahead there is one exercise in exercise first thing we have to define a person whose first name and last name so we have to define two variables whose first name is going to be tony last name is going to be stark then we have to define age in which we are storing 51 years of age after that is a genius is going to be a variable so tony is a genius now how you are defining with the help of boolean we have to write a code of 3-4 lines of that the solution of this exercise is given in the notes so first you have to try the exercise after that you have to see the solution next thing we are learning in python is to take input from user till now what we have learnt if we have to print something in python then how we can print it on screen now we will learn if we have to take something in input then how we can take it from user so for that we are using a function called input what does input do any value takes input from user so here we have to take input name what is your name here we have written question mark now if we run this code so here now we can input our name now we have input this name but this program has not stored it anywhere so let's make a variable for this we will store it in name run it again so here now we will print this name in next line so what happened here we have input name program has stored it in name variable and then we have printed the name so here the name which we have entered which was tony that has been printed on our screen so in this way we take input from user and store it in variable and then again to show it to user we print it to print it more nicely we can write hello here and we can put plus sign in between so what will happen with this plus sign with hello our name string will be joined and both will be printed together so this whole process is called concatenation in programming so let's run it run it so here we have to enter our name which is tony so hello tony has been printed for us now here is one more exercise that you have to ask user what is your superhero name or you can ask tony what is your superhero name so he will enter his superhero name or his superhero version and you have to store that name in a variable and print it on screen so this is a small exercise, you will get solution for this in notes next topic that we are talking about is type conversion we need type conversion because whenever we input anything in python so all our inputs come in a string format so if we input number if we input floating value if we input boolean all these things will come in string format like suppose we input someone's age we will store it in old age variable and here we will write our input function enter your old age now we have to convert this old age in new age to convert in new age what we will do in old age we will add 2 and finally we will print our new age so what we did, we made an old age variable we took input in it and put our old age in old age we added 2 years and the sum of both we put it in new age so sum is taken here in form of plus so we will add 2 with our old age and store it in new age so what happened with equal to right value went to left and then we printed new age now whenever we will execute this thing suppose our old age was 20 so here we got a type error what type error is saying can only concatenate string not int to string means we can concatenate string with string concatenate means it is trying to connect string with string but it is getting a number here it took 2 as a number but it took old age as a string now we don't have to send old age as a string, old age we passed 20 but it took 20 as a string so it is visualizing 20 in this way but we want it to be visualized in form of number so for that we will do type conversion for type conversion we use a function named int int represents integers so whole numbers complete numbers minus 1 all these numbers which don't have decimal point all those are integers we will pass old age in int so in this way its output will convert in old age in integer so here if we write int in that we passed old age and then run the code so now if we pass our age then we will get correct output now there will be no error now it is not like that only in integer we have to convert if we want then we can convert valid values in float or we can convert in string using str function we can convert any value in boolean so we will talk about 4 types of conversions in which valid variables we can convert in float float means where there is a decimal like if 18 we have a number in which value is stored now what we did we converted this number in float so let's see what will be its output its output is 18.0 so the number which was integer and there was no decimal we converted that also in decimal so in this way type conversions are there in python now what we will do we will write a small program so that we can get an idea how to write programs in python so we will write a code because of which we will calculate sum of two numbers so first we will make a variable and store our first number so here we will do input enter first number in the same way we will make a variable second, in second we will write input enter second number and now in sum what we will do first plus second we will store now its output will not be what we are thinking what we need to change first we will enter our first number suppose we enter 2 and then enter second number 3 so what we printed nothing yet because we didn't print sum so let's print sum run again here it printed 23 so why 23 of 2 and 3 printed because our first and second both are string we didn't convert type so here concatenation happened first is connected to second so 3 is connected to 2 to remove concatenation we have to convert it in int so first we will convert in int second we will convert in int then we will calculate sum run again so first we will pass 2 second we will pass 3 output is 5 so how to write sum of both we can write many programs in python now suppose before print we have to print the sum is and here we will write plus so in that case it will not print directly in that case error will come that we can't concatenate string with int so to print this sum we have to convert in string form then our sum will be printed correctly now in python we will talk about a special topic which is strings before using string we will define our string with name we will store tony stark now as soon as you type name. many things will appear on screen like index count, upper, replace, find so all these are called methods we can do many changes in string so we will read about these changes first change we can do in string is that if we want to convert all characters in upper case so for that method exists what we have to do after our string we have to write dot upper and then parenthesis now we have to print this after printing so in output all characters will be capitalized now this dot upper function it doesn't convert our string directly like if we print name after that it will be normal means it returned a new string with capital letters it didn't touch original string similarly if we want to convert all in lower then we will write lower so all characters will be converted in lower case next operation which we will talk about is find operation now in a string if we want to search any character or sub string so for that we can simply write dot find so suppose in Tony Stark we have to search for capital S so here we will write print name dot find we will pass our capital S in it now to define strings in python we can use double quotes or single quotes but since I am from C++ and Java background so when I have to define characters which means single A single B, single C, single at the rate so I use single quotes and when we have to define strings like word or sentence or a whole paragraph so I use double quotes you can use any quote as per your wish so here we are going to find this capital S in our name so this find will find any particular character or sub string in the string if it finds it so wherever it finds on index it will return the index and if it doesn't find it, it will return minus 1 what is index? in python, index is our position like if we talk about this name string so in this, on zeroth position comes T, on first position comes O, on second position comes N on third position comes Y on fourth position comes space so whatever are the indexes in python, they start from zero means they don't start from first position they start from zeroth position same is in C++ same is in Java but there are many languages which start from index 1 but we are talking about zero indexing so here if we run this code so where did it find S? on index 5 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on index 5 comes our capital S suppose we have to search small s so in that case here returns minus 1 because small s is not in our string apart from that we can find any sub string like suppose we want to find star that also starts from our index 5 but if we make s small of star so in that case minus 1 will be printed so in this way we have to be careful which case character or string we are searching now next operation which we will talk about is that in string we can pick any part and replace it with any other part like here instead of Tony Stark suppose in our string we have to remove all Tony Stark and replace it with Iron Man so how we do that? we print name.replace who do we want to replace? all Tony Stark who do we want to replace? with Iron Man so run it now what is printed for us? Iron Man but it doesn't change original string so if we print name again then our original name will be printed which is Tony Stark now suppose we want to print Tony Iron Man instead of Stark so from here we will remove Tony so we will be replacing Stark with this term so what is printed for us? Tony Iron Man so in this way we can replace existing substring or even whole string we can also replace characters if we replace T with M then we have Moni Stark so we can also replace characters now what does find function do? find function will bring index for us so in any position it will get a character or substring but we just have to check whether that substring or character exists or not we don't have to check its index so for that we use an in keyword what are keywords? like in any language there is a dictionary which defines that these words are part of this language similarly keywords of programming languages are part of dictionary of programming languages like in English language we know that apple is a word orange is a word when we use input so input is a keyword along with that we use print so print is also a keyword then only it is highlighted in our editor with purple rest of the variables which we define are not highlighted they are simply visible in white so all the keywords are highlighted if we are writing any text that is highlighted in green now if we want to find any character or substring in our string so we use in function we want to find capital T in name so for us print is true does our capital T exists in our name string so in that case for us print is true but if we want to find m so for that print will be false that m does not exist if we want to find substring that does star exist in name so for that it will be true now if we want to find iron man so for that it will be false so in this way we can search by getting true false in any string now next we are going to talk about arithmetic operators what are arithmetic operators like in math we have studied many operations whenever we have studied in 1st, 2nd, 3rd class of math we had to do plus so we used plus sign minus sign multiply so for all these operations the operator used that is the signs used we call them operators in python now here we will see different operators they are almost similar to what we have used in math first operator is plus so we will print 5 plus 2 so we will see sum from plus operator after that if we replace plus with minus so this is used for subtraction so it is 5 minus 2 print is 3 if we want to multiply so we will put asterisk so on our keyboard this asterisk sign is multiplication in programming so 5 into 2 is printed if we want to print so we will put slash slash means divide in arithmetic operators so we have printed 5 divided by 2 is equal to 2.5 now when we multiply any two numbers so either our result can be in decimal or in integer like here if we were dividing 10 by 2 so answer would have been 5 but if we are dividing 5 by 2 so answer is 2.5 suppose there are some cases where we don't want decimal numbers so to remove decimal numbers to take only integer value we will make this slash double so when we put two slashes or two divide signs so our decimal part will be removed from result so we run it so 2.5 is not printed only 2 is printed now along with this there is another operator in programming, it is in java, c++ and python which is not usual in maths it is our remainder operator it is also called modulo so this sign of percentage represents our remainder operator what does remainder operator do? when we divide two numbers so whatever remainder is left it returns that so we print this 5 divided by 2 remainder is 1 along with this there is another operator which is power operator so to make one number to make power of one number we put two asterisks or two stars so here we put star star it means 5 to the power 2 which is 25 when we run it it will be 25 printed now in python there are some shortcuts to calculate things which we should know so first of all let's assume we have a variable in which we wrote 5 in the beginning now what we did we added 2 in 5 and we assigned i to this whole so whenever there is such expression in python we can minimize it and write we can write this whole expression plus equal to 2 so this first line and this second line both have same meaning in python similarly if we want to minus then we can write minus equal to 2 and if we want to multiply then multiply equal to 2 so in this way we can perform many operations by minimizing them now in python let's talk about operator precedence operator precedence means if we have given some expression like 2 plus 3 into 5 or this expression can be 2 plus 3 means 5 into 5 25 or it can be 3 into 5 15 plus 2 so 17 now which one will be right it depends on which operator in python takes precedence means which operator will perform first operation so there is a rule of board math similarly there is a rule in python now the operator precedence has a whole chart which operator will take precedence you can get that in link here we will discuss in a little while we will discuss that multiplier operator has higher precedence as compared to plus operator so here result is 17 so first 3 into 5 will be multiplied after that 2 will be added if we want to add 2 first then we can put brackets if we put brackets then result will be 25 similarly here if we multiply then multiply will be before plus so after multiplying we get 2.6 so in this way we have precedence of different operators now let's discuss another small thing in python that is comments code part which doesn't do any calculation doesn't perform any operation means there are things which we have to write on our screen but we don't want to make them part of code suppose we want to write them in normal english so we call them comments how do we write comments suppose we write hash so all comments start with hash in python after that we can write here is a comment so this is a normal english line but here we will not get error why? because here we have made it a comment if we would have written this line below then we would have got an error so how can we write normal english in python we can write comments now what is the work of comments whenever we go to organizations or companies or start ups or whenever we are writing a good code so your code at some point of time someone else must be reading it now that person should understand which part of your long code performs for that you write a comment on every part like we made a small program of two numbers so in that first comment would have been taking input so first is equal to input we would have done something after that our second comment would have been calculate sum so in this way to define our program we can use comments now we are going to read in python about comparison operators comparison means comparing two things which is big and which is small now to compare in python there are some operators these operators return boolean value means whatever operator you have applied its true or false will depend on what condition you have applied so first of all we have to print 3 is greater than 2 so is 3 greater than 2 yes it is so its result will be true but here we can do 3 is less than 2 so this is a comparison operator in that case we will get return false in the same way less than equal to so in this also we will get false but if we write greater than equal to so it will be true now there is another comparison operator which compares two values so if we have to compare is 3 value equal to 2 value so in that case we will write equal to equal to so this operator will check if two values are equal or not if we run it then output will be false but if we write 3 instead of 2 so in that case we will get result as true now we have checked equal to equal to there is also an operator called not equal to to do not equal to you have to remove one equal to and in the beginning you have to put an exclamation mark exclamation means not now those students who have studied logic gates or in college in that we know that if we put not any value will be reversed so in python also when we put exclamation or not then everything will be reversed true becomes false and false becomes true so if we have to compare two values so 3 not equal to 3 the output we will get will be false and if we write 2 so its output will be true means when two values are equal and in between not equal to then its output is false means you are saying wrong but if two values are not equal and in between also not equal then its output will be true now next the operators we are going to study their name is logical operators in python there are 3 types of logical operators first is our OR operator what does OR operator do if we give two conditions to this operator suppose one condition is true and one condition is false so what will it do if one of the two condition is true so it will print true if both are false then it will print false so if we want to print 2 is greater than 3 or 2 is greater than 1 so here 2 is greater than 3 will return false and 2 is greater than 1 will return true so the final output that will return will be true now apart from this there is another operator that is AND operator what does AND operator do it will print true in all other cases it will print false so for example print 3 is greater than 2 and 2 is greater than 1 so in this case we will be getting print true but if we reverse any condition means if we make one condition false then we will get print false third logical operator in python is NOT operator what does NOT operator do it makes true false and false true for example if we want to print 2 is greater than 3 so 2 is greater than 3 should be the output but if we put NOT in front of it then its output will be true if we reverse it then it is possible that reverse of true will be false now let's talk about if-else statements what are if-else statements in programming whenever we have to apply any condition if this is the thing then this should work if not then this should work when we have such situations that if sun is rising then we print day if sun is setting then we print night so such conditions statements we execute in programming in python with the help of if-else statements so let's take a variable age we will store 16 in age or in the beginning we store 19 and how to write if condition if age is greater than equal to 18 so to use if-else we have to write keyword then condition then we have to put a colon so here we put a colon to show that we are going to write a block of sentences or statements block of statements means a combined statement pack so here we will print you are an adult and in the next line we will print you can vote the coders coming from C++ and Java for them block of codes here it was in the form of curly braces so here it was looking like opening curly brace and here closing curly brace but in python we don't apply braces for block of code here we do indentation indentation means giving proper space so here indentation means giving space of a tab of 4 spaces after this colon so it tells us that these two lines are part of if and after this if we write a line outside, say print thank you, so this thank you will be printed in every case these two lines will be printed when this condition is true, so let's run it by running it our age was 19 if checked that if our age is more than 18, then we will print these two lines, so for us both lines were printed and thank you was to be printed, now here if age was 16 then only thank you would be printed because this statement would be false now we can't apply only one if condition we can apply many other if conditions so the next if condition we will apply elif, elif means else if if the first condition is not true then you can check the second one this means elif so what we will do in elif if our age is less than 18 and age is greater than 3, so in that case what we have to do we have to print you are in school and all the remaining cases, means all the remaining ages for them we have to print you are a kid or you are a child because how many cases are left, those cases in which age is less than or equal to 3 now here we have written three keywords first was if, second was elif third is else, if defines our starting condition in elif we define if starting condition is not true then you can check the second one, if second one is not true then check the third one, now what else we do, if all the conditions above are not true then our else is executed if we reach else, if these two are false and we reach here then for us this will be printed so here we can define any age, suppose we wrote 13 so on that basis we got you are in school if we made age 2 then we got you are a child, so in this way we write if else statements in python, now what we do here we will make a mini project in mini project using python we have learned the concept till now, using that we will be building a calculator so to build calculator first of all we have to take our two operators means we have to take two numbers input from our user, so to take input of first number we write enter first number after that we will take our operator input, whether to do plus, minus multiply, divide or take modulo so we will be performing only 5 operations so our operator will also be input enter operator what are the options in operator plus, minus, multiply divide and modulo after that we will print our second number so input enter second number now we will put on these operators if else condition, if there is plus then we will print plus of first and second if there is minus then we will subtract first and second so in this way we will write if else if operator equal to equal to plus in that case we will print first plus second now we will copy this statement paste it here here will come minus here will come multiply here will come divide and here will come modulo and in end what we will do here we will do elif now again if and again what is the difference in writing elif elif means this condition will be checked only when this condition is false but if we write here then all the conditions are checked whether the above one is false or true and we will write else case in else case we will write print invalid operation now notice one thing here our first and second these are not numbers but strings so convert first in the form of number run this code after running we enter first number 2 enter second number before that enter our operator we have to multiply 2 with 2 so output is 4 execute it again this time we want to divide 5 2sic so output is 2.5 so in this way we have built our mini calculator which will use fs conditions and perform all the operations it will perform so if you know python and you have laptop sometimes calculator gets spoiled internet is down and there is no calculator app which is highly impractical situation so in that situation you can make your own calculator and cheat in exam now next thing we are going to study is range in python in python range is a range of numbers range means going from one value to another value so if in python we wrote range of 5 so it means here we want to write numbers 0,1,2,3 and 4 so from 0 to 5 we are defining all the numbers with the help of range but last number is not included so range of 5 if we store it in numbers and then print numbers so result will be range of numbers from 0 to 5 in which 5 is not included so range is actually a keyword and from parenthesis we are getting to know range is a function in python range function in which if you pass any number it returns a list of numbers a sequence now in python next and very important concept which we are talking about is loop so let's understand loop suppose we want to print 1, then print 2 then print 3 then print 4 then print 5 now in the same way we have printed values from 1 to 5 these will come to us on the output screen but we have to print from 1 to 100 so are we writing print statement again and again not at all because programming is a game of smart people in which all the hard work is to be minimized someone or the other comes so here also to minimize our work a concept came which we call loops in python first we will talk about while loop while means in english it means till so you give a condition till that condition is true till then your work will be done as soon as condition will be false your work will stop so what we will do we will define a variable in this variable we will assign value 1 now we will write while, while is a keyword in python and now we will write our condition till our i is less than or equal to 5 till then you print our i and here we will update i every time i is equal to i plus 1 so here i is starting with 1 this while loop will run till our i is less than or equal to 5 we will print i every time and increase 1 in it so if we run this code so we will get 1,2,3,4,5 how it will print earlier value of i was 1 now i is less than or equal to 5 so 1 is printed now because of this statement i is increased to 2 2 is less than or equal to 5 so 2 is printed in the same way all our numbers will be printed on the screen now here if we would not have written update then what would have happened again and again 1 would have been printed because value of i is always 1 and 1 point would have come after which our computer memory would have been filled and our program would have crashed that's why these loops in which this condition is removed are called infinite loop we should never write infinite loop in our code otherwise our code will crash now here if we write 100 instead of 5 so we can print all the numbers till 100 if we write 10000 so we can print all the numbers till 10000 and you saw how fast we printed all the numbers in our python code so in the same way code is very fast and takes very less time to perform every operation and these numbers till 10000 we would have printed so it would have taken a lot of time now if we want to print any pattern like during our placement we get questions so here value of i is equal to stars and we will print 5 so in this case some structure would have been printed so what happened here as much as value of i so many stars were printed so here first 1 star then 2 star then 3 star then 4 star then 5 star and this multiply so it was very easy to connect the strings so multiply also works so you can multiply any number with any string so that string will be printed for us as much as time so here if it was hello so here it would have been hello once, hello twice and here it would have been hello three times so if we want to print the pattern of stars here we have to print star and instead of plus 1 we have to print minus 1 so our pattern is printed in reverse so our triangle is in reverse and is on screen so in this way our while loops work in python now we will talk about for loops for loops in python usually we have a list a structure to iterate on it to put loop on it so for loop is used basically you have an object or sequence of numbers to take the items of it like if we have defined a range from 0 to 4 so we have to print all the numbers of this range so what we will do is for i in range print i so here all the numbers which are in range will be printed so here we used the keyword for in keyword and then whatever item is written we can write item here also we can write item we wrote in keyword and then range so all the items in range are printed for us now let's say we have to print from 1 to 5 so here we have to print item plus 1 so in this way plus 1 is printed in all the items so from 1 to 5 all the numbers are printed so in this way our for loop works in python now let's talk about list in python so till now the data types which we have read string, float, integer, boolean these are all primitive data types after this comes list data type in list we can store many primitive data types so list can be called collection of items this is a complex data type like if we have to make a list so let's say we have to store our marks so we can store marks in a form of list so to make a list we use square brackets in this we store our marks first english marks then chemistry marks then physics marks so in this way we stored marks and after that if we have to print these marks then we can do print marks we run the code so all the marks are printed for us so this variable marks is a list now it's not like in list all the data types are same here if we want to store maths then we can run it so for us that will also be printed now if we want to print marks of an individual subject then how to do it we will print it by writing square brackets in front of marks so in square brackets we can print any index marks we can print any index marks let's say we want to print marks on 0th index so this is 0 index, this is 1 index and this is 2 index so 0 index marks will be printed which is 95 if we want to print 1st index then it will be 98 now usually in other languages the index is positive here also we talked about how the index is increasing 0,1,2,3,4 so in python the index can be negative also so if we wrote 1 here then we can write it as minus 1 minus 1 means in python index that start counting from back so minus 1 means our last item so we printed it so 97 is printed for us similarly if we write minus 2 then it will be 98 so minus means we are starting counting from back this comes on minus 1 this comes on minus 2 and this on minus 3 now if we print minus 4 then list index will be out of range because there is nothing happening behind this now if we don't want marks of last subject we just want marks of first two index so for that we can make a new list how can we make a new list we can write marks then we will write from which starting index to which ending index you want list so starting index will be 0 and ending index will be 2 so here ending index is not included so 0 colon 2 means 0 and 1 will be included so let's print it so for us output is 95 and 98 similarly 1 and 3 means that we are taking 1 and 2 so 1 will not be included but 0 will also not be included so in that case it will be 98 and 97 now this whole list every item of this every score we can make a loop on it which loop we will make here we will make for loop so we will write for score in marks print our score so this score will be printed for us so it will be 95 and 98 and 97 so one by one we can access all the scores of marks now marks list we have made on list also we can perform many operations like we performed operations on string similarly we will perform operations on list so first operation we will talk about is append operation append means to add something so if we have taken marks of maths we have to add marks we will write marks.append and what we will pass in it whatever new marks we have to add so we have added 99 so we have added that after that we will print our marks so in our marks now 99 at the end has been added or append apart from this we will also insert suppose we are able to add something in the end suppose we have to add something in the middle so for that we will use insert so here we will remove append insert if we have to add marks of maths in the beginning so first we have to write index for beginning index is 0 and marks will be 99 so we will run it so 99 is now in the beginning means start of the list apart from this in our list which item exists we can also check that how will we check that suppose we have to check that our number 99 exists in our list or not so for that we will print 99 in marks so what will this in keyword do it will check whether 99 exists in marks so yes it exists that's why it is printed true for us if we search here 93 so for that it would be false so we can perform this operation we get the length of marks that how many elements are there in our list what is the length so here if we print len and pass our marks in it so the length of our marks list will be printed for us means 4 is printed for us if we have to remove marks of maths and print it so for us in that case it would be 3 so till now we have iterated on marks so we can use length with the help of for loop so first we will define a variable i is equal to 0 now we will write our while loop while our i is less than length of marks till then we will keep on printing marks of i and we will update i by 1 so what happened in this with the help of while loop so our marks are printed one by one for us now if we have to empty the whole list so for that we will use a operation marks.clear with the help of clear if we print our marks after this so an empty list will be printed so what will clear do it will empty the whole list so we have read some operations on our list now we are going to talk about break and continue are two important keywords in python these keywords are also there in c++ and java so now with an example we will understand what is the meaning of these keywords first of all we will make a list in the list some students names will be stored ram, shyam, kishan radha, radhika so these are some 5 students names now our work is we have to print all these names one by one and while printing we have to take care of one thing as soon as radha name comes after that we don't have to print any name means from ram till the time radha name comes till then we have to print all the names so how will we do for that we will put a for loop for student in students we will keep on printing our students but as soon as now here we are writing if statement in for loop so this is a new use case we should see this carefully if our student's name is equal to radha's so in that case we will do break what is the meaning of this for means we have iterated all the students we have to print students every time but as soon as our student's name is radha before that we will do break break means breaking that loop and get out of it means after this loop will end so wherever we have to end the loop we use break keyword now if we run this then only ram, kishan will be printed and after that the name will not be printed now there is one more keyword continue kishan was a student of our class but his parents got transferred to another state and now he has shifted so he got his name cut from school and his name should not be printed in the list now we have to print name of everyone except kishan so here we change the condition if student is equal to kishan then in that case continue means run our loop again don't do any work of the current loop so if we run this then all the students name will be printed except kishan so in this way our continue works in python now the next structure which we are going to talk about in python is called tuple tuple is like a list but immutable means once you make tuple you can't change it like in list we were able to insert things append things so that type of addition, modify or delete operation is not there in tuple so if we have to define tuple of marks so here we write marks is equal to now we define tuple in parenthesis form like in list we used to use square brackets now we will use our parenthesis we will store our marks in marks 95 for english 98 for chemistry 97 for physics now if we have to do marks of maths or we don't want to keep 95 on 0th index we want to keep 99 so what we will do marks of 0 is equal to 99 but here we will get an error why error will come because tuple object doesn't support item assignment because we are trying to change our tuple so we can't do this so tuples are immutable now we are talking about two operations first operation is it counts which object is how many times like if we write 97 three times and we want to print and we want to count how many times 97 came so we will write marks dot count if we want to count 97 in count so we will pass 97 and 3 is printed for us now we want to see how many times 95 came so 1 is printed similarly if we want to see index of any number in tuple so we will print marks dot index now which ever number we want to see say we want to see 97 so if 97 is coming three times so first time when 97 will come its index will be printed for us so 2 is printed for us 95 is on 0, 98 on 1 and 97 on 2 first time so this is how tuple works next structure we will talk about in python is set now we have studied about sets in maths what were sets like if we want to store collection of many elements but we want to keep only unique elements not duplicates so in that case we used set similarly sets are there in python now if we want to make tuple a set so for that we will change this bracket and here we will bring curly braces so till now what we have learnt when square brackets comes then we have list when parenthesis comes then we have tuple and when curly braces comes then we have set so we can differentiate like this now one more special thing that in tuples putting parenthesis is not compulsory means if you will write person is equal to ram comma sham comma abhi so this structure will be by default a tuple if we print this so for us it will be a tuple after printing so these parenthesis are not compulsory they are optional but code should be good so that the reader knows what we have tried to print that's why we use parenthesis so here we have defined set now in set 97 is 3 times but if we print our marks so 97 will be printed only once once because unique values are stored in set second thing if we try to print marks of 0 then error will come error will come because in marks in sets index doesn't exist means which value is on which index no idea if you want to iterate on this so you can only run a loop you can't access values from index we will remove this and now we will run so for us all our marks are printed now since in sets index doesn't exist that's why it is called unordered order means fixed sequence of things so where index is there it is called ordered if index is not there in sets then it is called unordered there is another structure like this in python which is called dictionary dictionary is a very important structure in dictionary we store key value pairs like if we want to store single student's information then we will do it in tuple, set or list but with student always parent's information should come key and value when information is stored in two pairs then it is stored in dictionary like if we want to convert our key in dictionary so for that we will convert like this first we will put curly braces then we will write our key our key is english then we will put colon then we will store marks of english 95, then we will store marks of chemistry colon 98 so like this we have kept our key as subject and we have kept our value as marks if we were storing student's information then we would have made a dictionary like this first would have been student's father's name like this so like this student would have stored parent's information now if we want to access any information like we want to print marks of chemistry so here we will write marks of chemistry so in first index we used to write number now we can write key instead of number so here we have passed chemistry as index and for us marks of chemistry will be printed which is 98 now if we want to add new marks then how to add here we can write marks now after that we have to print marks of physics so first we will add marks of physics 97 now we will print our marks so here we have English here we have chemistry and here we have physics now we can change existing marks in dictionary so if we want to make marks of physics as 99 instead of 97 so what we will do marks of physics is equal to 99 and after that we will print our marks so here marks of physics will be printed in second line now let's talk about functions like we have a TV remote so by pressing different buttons of remote we can do different things like if we press plus plus button then volume will increase if we press minus minus button then volume will decrease so every button is performing different operation similarly in python code there are different parts of program every part performs an operation and if this part performs specific operation then we call it function so there are three types of functions in python first are inbuilt function second are module function and third are user defined function which is defined by user which we are writing now inbuilt function we have already read it inbuilt function means like we read int in our type conversion or we read str or we read bool these functions are our inbuilt function which already exists in python and we use them directly second type of function are module function now what are modules in java when related functions and related variables are stored in one file we name that file module in python now there are many modules in python we can use them directly and we can get our work done from their functions like example of such module is math module to use math module we have to write in our code import math now in math module there are many functions which are already written how can we print these functions dir of math so as we print dir of math similarly all these functions which are printing on screen are functions of math module now if we pick any particular function then we have picked square root now if we only need square root function then we can from math import sqrt and what does sqrt function do it returns square root of any number so if we print sqrt of 4 so in that case square root of 4 will be printed which is 2.0 similarly if we print 16 then it will be 4.0 similarly we can take functions instead of module suppose we need all functions then we can do star star means select all so in that case all functions will be available and we can use square root directly now third type of function in python is user defined function which is made by programmers now what is syntax syntax means proper way of writing so till now we were using proper keywords proper things, space that was all syntax of python now syntax of writing function is first you write definition after definition we write definition means daf here we will define our function after that we write function name so function name is a variable which we can give by our self that we want to keep function name after that we write parenthesis after parenthesis we write some parameters parameters means some function may be taking some input and on that input basis returning some output like if we convert calculator into function then calculator will take operator and will depend on what output will come so that will become calculator parameter so parameter comes after that colon comes and finally inside all lines we have to write together block of code of function we can write that so suppose we want to write a function what this function does it prints sum of two numbers so how to write function first we will write def we will write function name print sum now after print sum we will write parenthesis, inside parenthesis we will take two numbers first will be first second will be second then we will write colon and second will be parameters in which we will pass some number and here we will print first plus second and from here we will call call any function means execute it run it so to call print sum we will write print sum, parenthesis inside that we will pass parameters whatever parameters we want to give in first we want to give one and this print sum will print sum for us so let's run it so sum of one and two is directly printed which is three now suppose we want to keep value of by default parameter like second number if nothing is passed in that then second will become four so suppose we didn't pass anything in place of two, only one so in that case by default second will be four and sum of one and four will be five so in this way our functions work in python so i hope all the concepts of python we have discussed today now after this if we want to go in programming, want to study for placement want to study for competitive programming so we can learn oops in python or if we want to go to machine learning or if we want to go to data science or artificial intelligence so we can study related modules like file handling in python and if we want to go to development so we can learn framework named django i hope your coming journey of python will be good apart from this if you want video related to python or machine learning or related to AI so you can comment below that's all for today till then keep learning and keep practicing Thank you"
