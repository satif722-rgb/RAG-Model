"Hello! You're looking for information on when variables are taught in the course. I'd be happy to help you with that.

Variables are introduced in the first video of the Python Tutorial for Beginners series, which is Video 1. In this video, starting at timestamp 678 seconds and continuing until 680 seconds, the instructor explains what variables are and how they work in Python.

If you want to check it out yourself, you can go back to Video 1 on your course platform or watch the video again from scratch. You should see an explanation of variables around that time mark.

Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"{"query_num": 1, "query": "hello", "response": "I'd be happy to help with your Python programming course. What's the question?"}
